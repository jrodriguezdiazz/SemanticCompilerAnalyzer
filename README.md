# Python to JavaScript Transpiler

Welcome to our Python to JavaScript Transpiler! This innovative application is designed to seamlessly convert basic Python code into JavaScript code. By utilizing a robust lexical analyzer for tokenization and a syntactic analyzer to generate an abstract syntax tree (AST), this tool bridges the gap between Python and JavaScript, allowing developers to streamline their coding workflow.

## Features

Our transpiler comes equipped with a suite of functionalities to enhance your development experience:

- **Import Python Code**: Easily upload your Python code into the application. Our transpiler will handle the complexities of parsing and transforming your code into JavaScript.

- **Execute Codes**: With a simple click, execute both the original Python code and the transpiled JavaScript code. This feature is designed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the transpilation process, providing you with instant feedback on the performance of your code in both languages.

- **Export JavaScript Code**: After successful transpilation, export the generated JavaScript code with ease. This allows you to integrate the JavaScript version of your code into your projects without any additional hassle.
